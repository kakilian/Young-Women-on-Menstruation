The favicon is simple and clear, indicating the website is made for teens. It is inclusive and designed to help everyone understand what is going on.

### Font

I chose accessible fonts like Lato and Oswald. Although I considered a handwritten font, feedback indicated it might not be supported on all mobile phones, especially older models often used by my target audience.

### Navbar

The navigation bar is present on all 5 pages for easy user control, it is fully responsive navagation bar includes links to the logo, Home Page, Gallery and Contact/Answer pages. It is identical on all pages, allowing for easy navigation

This section allows the users to navigate from page to page and also to go back one page. By using the dropdown Navigation bar on a mobil phone or clicking on it on a pc.

### Homepage
![Homepage](assets/image/testing-for-project/cover.jpg)

Introduction from myself, and my role in the community as a mother, nurse, and friend. I have picked a faceless photo, as I believe at this age it can be an awkard stage in their lifes. I also tried to keep it simple. With only a short text to get the user to look further into the website.

- The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to get connected via sozial media.

## Road Map

- Interactive Quizzes or Assessments
Develop interactive quizzes or assessments related to menstruation, self-care, and health to engage users and provide personalized recommendations based on their responses.

- Community Forums or Support groups
USing establish community forums or support groups outside of the interent where users can connect if they want to share experiences or need more support outside of the website.

- Questions and Answers
Letting users see past questions, where they could possible relate to and would be able to share their experiences.

- Forschung 
Sharing possible links into further education and the ongoing research using it as an educational porthole. Not only to educate but to enpower them along their journey.

- Partner Information
Teaching not only information to the immediate user, but also helping their brothers, friends, family to be informed or "How to help" - "What does this mean" - I got approached by a couple of teenagers in my daughters age asking about what they could do, after looking at APP they found it very informative. So it would be good to have a little corner for them too. 


### Colors and Meanings
![Pink Color](assets/image/testing-for-project/color-pink.jpg)
